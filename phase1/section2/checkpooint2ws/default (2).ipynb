    "You work in a robot lab that has recently acquired new mobile base robots. These robots are used for testing various robotic algorithms. Sometimes, these algorithms fail, and the robots need to be moved using a teleoperation interface. You might already be familiar with the **teleop_twist_keyboard** tool, which can be cumbersome for frequent teleoperation tasks. Your goal in this project is to develop a user-friendly graphical interface that even those with little or no previous experience in robotics can use to interact with the robots remotely. You will create this interface using C++, ROS, and the CVUI library. As with any typical ROS system, the project involves several ROS nodes communicating with each other and the Graphical Interface. As such this GUI is fed with information from a variety of ROS nodes that provide the data that is shown to the user. Similarly the user interface publishes information or calls ROS services through the ROS network. While some of these additional ROS nodes have already been provided, you will also be required to write one additional ROS node yourself, utilizing the knowledge and skills you have acquired throughout this course. Writing this node will enable you to gain further experience in writing C++ with ROS and help you to solidify your understanding of important C++ concepts. \n",

Instead, the main emphasis is on the underlying implementation of all features using C++ and ensuring their correct functioning via the graphical interface."
